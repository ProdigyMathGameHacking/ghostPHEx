## How to use
- Make sure ghostPHEX is installed. Once you're positive it's installed, proceed to the next step.
- [Go to prodigy](https://play.prodigygame.com)
- Log in as normal. PHEX will warn you that the extension is outdated and the hacks might not work. Click `Cancel` and proceed (Clicking `OK` would kick you off). 
- After 10-20 seconds, a small arrow should appear at the top left of your screen. Click it, and the hacks should appear.
